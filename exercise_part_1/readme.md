## Exerices Part 1

1. Modify Hello.cpp so that it prints out your name and age
(or shoe size, or your dog’s age, if that makes you feel
better). Compile and run the program.

2. Using Stream2.cpp and Numconv.cpp as guidelines,
create a program that asks for the radius of a circle and
prints the area of that circle. You can just use the ‘*’
operator to square the radius. Do not try to print out the
value as octal or hex (these only work with integral
types).

3. Create a program that opens a file and counts the
whitespace-separated words in that file.

4. Create a program that counts the occurrence of a
particular word in a file (use the string class’ operator
‘==’ to find the word).

5. Change Fillvector.cpp so that it prints the lines
(backwards) from last to first.

6. Change Fillvector.cpp so that it concatenates all the
elements in the vector into a single string before printing
it out, but don’t try to add line numbering.

7. Display a file a line at a time, waiting for the user to press
the “Enter” key after each line.

8. Create a vector<float> and put 25 floating-point numbers
into it using a for loop. Display the vector.

9. Create three vector<float> objects and fill the first two as
in the previous exercise. Write a for loop that adds each
corresponding element in the first two vectors and puts
the result in the corresponding element of the third
vector. Display all three vectors.

10. Create a vector<float> and put 25 numbers into it as in
the previous exercises. Now square each number and put
the result back into the same location in the vector.
Display the vector before and after the multiplication.
